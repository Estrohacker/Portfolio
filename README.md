# My Projects
* **[How to analyze twitter](https://github.com/estrohacker/como-analizar-twitter)**

A serie of exercises regarding Twitter. This is my biggest project until now. It is placed in a separated repository because I have given two presentations and this way people will find the methods more easily.

* **[Análisis de hashtags de Twitter con Python](My%20Projects/Analisis%20de%20hashtags%20de%20Twitter%20con%20Python.ipynb)**: análisis del hashtag #aquiestamoslasfeministas usando t-hoarder, Gephi y Python. Proyecto para la Universidad de Granada.
* **[Twitter hashtag analysis with Python](My%20Projects/Twitter%20hashtag%20analysis%20with%20Python.ipynb)**: an analysis of hashtag #aquiestamoslasfeministas using t-hoarder, Gephi and Python. Project for the University of Granada.

This is the first hashtag I analyzed. It is important because it was a real analysis and I answered several questions I made myself before the analysis.
